I'm new to Fritzing parts creation, but here's a repository containing over 50+ Fritzing parts to for designers and tech-enthusiasts to use for digital electronics and logic circuit design, focusing on the 74LS series ICs.

<h2 align="center"> <strong> 🎯 Goal 🎯  </strong> </h2>

The goal of this project is to provide a comprehensive set of Fritzing parts for educational purposes. By making these parts freely available, and encouraging learners and designers to easily plan ahead and create projects in digital electronics or logic circuit design.
